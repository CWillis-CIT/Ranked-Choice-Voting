User Input:

The program first asks how many total voters there are.

Then, for each voter, you provide a comma-separated list of candidates in ranked order (e.g., "FirstChoice,SecondChoice,ThirdChoice").

Ballot Creation:

Each voterâ€™s ranking is stored in a new Ballot object.

Ranked Choice Election:

After collecting all ballots the array is passed to Election.processElection.

The Election and Candidate classes already implement the RCV logic:

Tally votes based on first-choice preferences, check for a majority, eliminate the lowest candidate, and repeat until a winner is found.
